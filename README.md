Graphing and plotting
There are 2 mini projects : - 
      A. PyberRideSharing - 
              (i) PyberRideSharing.ipynb	(Code)
              (ii) city_data.csv	(Data file 1)
              (iii) ride_data.csv (Data file 2)
      B. Pymaceuticals - 
                (i) Pymaceuticals.ipynb (Code)
                (ii) mouse_drug_data.csv (Data file 1)
                (iii) clinicaltrial_data.csv (Data file 2)
                

In analysis of PyberRideSharing following was done:- 
           Analysis was done by Calculating $ Displaying Average Fare, date, Total Number of Rides, Total Number of Drivers based on City.
           Graph was plotted on 'Total Number of Rides' and 'Average fare' for Urban, Sub-Urban, and Rural
(i) It Was found that 
     a. the Average Fare in Urban areas were higher than Sub-Urban which in turn was higher than the Rural. 
     b. The number of drivers were more in Urban areas.
     c. There were lesser number or rides hence the number of drivers were less than Urban and Sub - urban in rural areas 
     d. Average fare in Rural areas was less than Urban and Sub - urban in rural areas 
          Analysis by plotting Pie Charts was done
